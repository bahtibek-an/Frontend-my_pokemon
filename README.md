# Task
What is the problem? And where is the challenge?

The Pokémon franchise revolves around 1021 fictional species of collectible monsters, each having unique designs, skills and powers. Conceived by Satoshi Tajiri in early 1989, Pokémon (or Pocket Monsters) are fictional creatures that inhabit the fictional Pokémon World. The designs for the multitude of species can draw inspiration from anything such as animals, plants and mythological creatures. Many Pokémon are capable of evolving into more powerful species, while others can undergo form changes and achieve similar results. Originally, only a handful of artists led by Ken Sugimori designed Pokémon. However, by 2013 a team of 20 artists worked together to create new species designs. 
Sugimori and Hironobu Yoshida lead the team and determine the final designs.

At the start of a main series Pokémon game, the player character receives one of three "starter" Pokémon, with which they can battle and catch other Pokémon. Each Pokémon has one or two "types", such as Fire, Water, or Grass. In battle, certain types are strong against other types. 
For example, a Fire-type attack will do more damage to a Grass-type Pokémon—rather than a Water-type attack.[6] This form of gameplay is frequently compared to that of rock-paper-scissors, though players have to strategize which Pokémon and which of their attacks to use against various opponents.

# Description
How have you solved the problem?

Due to the large number of Pokémon, listing of each species is divided into articles by generation. 
1017 of the 1021 Pokémon are organized by their number in the National Pokédex—an in-game electronic encyclopedia that provides various information on Pokémon. The National Pokédex is subdivided into regional Pokédex series, each revolving around species introduced at the time of their respective generations along with older generations. For example, the Johto Pokédex, Generation II, covers the 100 species introduced in Gold and Silver in addition to the original 151 species. The encyclopedias follow a general ordering: starter Pokémon are listed first, followed by species obtainable early in the respective games and are concluded with Legendary and Mythical Pokémon. 
Generation V is a notable exception, as Victini is the first Pokémon in the Unova Pokédex.
