In this project I got full knowledge about "api" and also used "api" in my project. this project is a game "Pokemon" in which pokemon of different levels and pokemon of different appearance will fight. You can also upgrade your pokemon to level 3. it has become very popular since 2016. So it's been 8 years since this game gained its reputation.

### Features

Pokémon are classified into 18 types based on their characteristics. For example, Pikachu is an Electric type Pokémonand Magikarp is a Water type. There are some Pokémon who belong to two types, such as Jigglypuff, who is both Normal and Fairy. Each type has special affinities that have a big effect on battles. If your opponent's Pokémon has the right type of affinity, it can be a huge advantage in battle
