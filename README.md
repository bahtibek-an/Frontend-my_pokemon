## Task

The primary objective of the Pokemon Project is to create a web application using the ReactJS library. The application should include a Pokemon search function and a Pokemon list, allowing users to click on a specific Pokemon to view detailed information.

## Description

The Pokemon Project is a ReactJS-based web application that offers users the ability to search for and view details about various Pokemon. The main features include:

- **Pokemon Search Functionality**: Users can search for specific Pokemon using the search functionality. The search results dynamically update as users type, providing an efficient and user-friendly experience.

- **Pokemon List**: The application displays a list of Pokemon, allowing users to browse through the available Pokemon.

- **Pokemon Details**: Clicking on a specific Pokemon in the list opens a detailed view. This view presents comprehensive information about the selected Pokemon, including attributes such as name, image, stats, type, and more.

## Installation

To set up the Pokemon Project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pokemon-project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd pokemon-project
   ```

3. Install dependencies using npm or yarn:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

## Usage

Once the installation is complete, you can run the Pokemon Project:

```bash
npm start
```

or

```bash
yarn start
```

This command will start the development server, and you can access the application by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

Explore the Pokemon search function, browse the Pokemon list, and click on individual Pokemon to view detailed information.
