# Description

Pokémon[a] is a Japanese media franchise consisting of video games, animated series and films, a trading card game, and other related media. The franchise takes place in a shared universe in which humans co-exist with creatures known as Pokémon, a large variety of species endowed with special powers. The franchise's target audience is children aged 5 to 12,[1] but it is known to attract people of all ages.[2][3][4][5]

The original full name of the franchise is Pocket Monsters (ポケットモンスター, Poketto Monsutā), which was abbreviated to Pokemon during development of the original games. When the franchise was released internationally, the short form of the title was used, with an acute accent (´) over the e to aid in pronunciation.[9]
