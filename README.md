## Welcome to My Pokemon App
Hello my dear friend. I'm so glad you're checking out my Pokemon app project.<br><br>

## Task

The task of this project was to create a pokemon app clone via API and I think I succeeded.<br><br>
## Description

I learned how to work with API in this project and it helped me to learn new things<br><br>
