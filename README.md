# Pokéfight-Frontend (Study Project)

A small SPA for Pokébouts.

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/932d7264-f7f8-4727-883f-f8307bc0cbab/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/pokefight-videlicet/deploys)

## Performance

The <a href="https://github.com/videlicet/Pokefight-Server" target="_blank">server</a> is deployed on render. It can take up to one minute until it respondes if it has been idling. 

The number of browsable pokémon is reduced to the first generation to improve performance.

## Acknowledgements

Frontend built with:
* JavaScript, React.js, HTML5, CSS3

## How to Run

Replace the default export in `URL_SERVER_DOMAIN.js` with the domain of your server.
