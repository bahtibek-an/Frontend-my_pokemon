My Pokémon App

Task
The project's primary goal is to create a multi-page application using ReactJS, enabling users to explore a list of Pokémon, view their details, and search for specific Pokémon. The development involves fetching data from an external API, implementing lazy loading for the Pokémon list, handling errors gracefully, and ensuring a smooth user experience.

Description
This application is constructed using ReactJS, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It comprises multiple components, each serving a specific purpose. The primary components are:

PokemonList: This component fetches data from an external API to display a list of Pokémon cards. It supports lazy loading, ensuring that additional Pokémon will be loaded as the user scrolls down the list.

PokemonDetails: When a user clicks on a Pokémon card in the PokemonList, this component reveals detailed information about the selected Pokémon.

The project is organized with each component in a separate file inside the src/components/ directory. Associated CSS files are provided for each component to style them appropriately.
