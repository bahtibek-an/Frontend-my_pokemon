# Getting Started with Create React App

I started the download of the react app by issuing the command 'npx create-react-app' in the terminal

## Available Scripts

I used the command 'npm run build' in this project from the command 'npm run build' I used this command in the terminal to get the link for my my_pokenmon project
m and I used the opportunity to get a free link from 'netlify.app' site.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**
Runs the app in the development mode.\

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
