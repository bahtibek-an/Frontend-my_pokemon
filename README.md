# Welcome to my pokemon app <a https://davron-qwasar-pokemon01.netlify.app/">My Pokemon App</a>

---

## Task

The task of this project is to create a multiple-page application using ReactJS that allows users to explore a list of Pokemon, view their details, and search for specific Pokemon. The project involves fetching data from an external API, implementing lazy loading for the Pokemon list, handling errors gracefully, and ensuring a smooth user experience.

## Description

This project is built using ReactJS, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It consists of multiple components, each serving a specific purpose. The main components are as follows:

1. PokemonList: This component fetches data from the external API to display a list of Pokemon cards. It supports lazy loading, meaning that additional Pokemon will be loaded as the user scrolls down the list.

2. PokemonDetails: When a user clicks on a Pokemon card in the PokemonList, this component displays detailed information about the selected Pokemon.

The project is structured with each component in a separate file inside the src/components/ directory. Associated CSS files are provided for each component to style them accordingly.
